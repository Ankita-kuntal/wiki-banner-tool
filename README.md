# Dynamic Banner and Form UI

## Project Description
This project features a simple webpage with two main elements:
1. **A full-width banner** that describes something enjoyable.
2. **A form** that includes controls to dynamically change aspects of the banner without reloading the page.

## Features
- A full-width banner that includes text and an image.
- A form with JavaScript-powered controls to modify:
  - The banner's background color.
  - The banner's text content.
  - The banner image.
- Real-time updates to the banner when users interact with the form.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic interactivity and event handling.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Use the form to select a background color, modify the banner text, or change the image.
3. Observe instant updates to the banner.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the page.
4. To make further changes, edit `script.js` and `styles.css` as needed.

## Code Structure
- `index.html` → Contains the structure of the banner and form.

## How to Commit and Push Changes

   ```
2. Commit with a descriptive message:
